<h3>What is this app?</h3>
<p>This app is an experiment designed to test if Angular 2+ templates 
    can be handy or at least usable for generating tile images in SVG format.</p>
<p>We call "tile image" an image which when replicated side by side in a grid
    creates the impression of a repetitive ornament where separate tiles can fit together seamlessly
    or, on the opposite, be themselves the main repetitive pattern.
</p>
<p>SVG format is an open standard for vector graphics, it's "web native" i.e. 
    supported by all modern browsers and can also be easily imported into 
    professional graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator to be converted
    to a rasterized image or used in a larger graphic design project. It is 
    also human readable; all this makes SVG a good choice for such a web-based 
    tool.
</p>

<h3>How to use it?</h3>
<p>One needs to be familiar with SVG format and Angular 2 (or later Angular version) templates
    at least at some basic level; as Angular templates use expressiions closely
    resembling those of Javascript some Javascript knowledge would also be very useful. 
</p>
<p>The app starts with a demo template rendered and editable. It doesn't include
    the enclosing <code>&lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</code> tags and are added to the 
    template by the app before rendering. The app replicates the SVG element
    generated from the template in a 3x3 grid so the user can see how the tiles
    fit together. The user can make app show tile borders (grid lines) and change 
    tile dimensions. The resulting SVG code for a single tile can be saved locally 
    by clicking "Save SVG" link.
</p>

<h3>Helper <code>tools</code> object</h3>
<p>The application provides a helper object, <code>tools</code>, to simplify writing
    templates for SVG tile images. The object's only method, <code>generateGrid(config)</code>, 
    returns a 2-dimensional array (an array of "rows" each being an array of objects)
    based on the configuration object passed as the argument.
</p>
<p>This argument object's properties describe the parameters of the grid in the following format
    (the values of the properties shown in the example below are default: they will be used if 
    no value is set for that key):
</p>
<pre><code>tools.generateGrid(&#123;
    rowsCount: 5,
    columnsCount: 5,
    xSpacing: 100,
    ySpacing: 100
&#125;)
</code></pre>
<p><code>rowsCount</code> and <code>columnsCount</code> properties set the number of rows and 
    columns in the 2-dimensional array returned by the method and <code>xSpacing</code> and 
    <code>ySpacing</code> set the increment of grid element objects' <code>x</code> and 
    <code>y</code> properties.
</p>
<p>So the app's user can use Angular's <code>*ngFor</code> directive to iterate
    over rows and columns of the generated 2-dimensional array and use grid "cell"
    objects' properties to position SVG elements and set their attributes, as in the 
    example below:
</p>
<pre><code #example1>&lt;g *ngFor="let row of tools.generateGrid(&#123;
    rowsCount: 10,
    columnsCount: 10,
    xSpacing: 75,
    ySpacing: 75
&#125;)"&gt;
    &lt;circle *ngFor="let cell of row"
            r="30"
            [attr.cx]="cell.x"
            [attr.cy]="cell.y"
            [attr.fill]="['red','blue'][(cell.row+cell.col)%2]"&gt;
    &lt;/circle&gt;
&lt;/g&gt;
</code></pre>
<a href="#" 
   (click)="requestEdit(example1);false"
   class="try-link">Try this template in the app</a>
<p>This template will make the application generate the following pattern (dashed
    lines are tiles' borders):</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="assets/result-example-1.png">
</div>
<p>Several important things should be mentioned about this example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>binding attributes of SVG elements to Angular expressions 
        should be done using <code>[attr.<i>attribute_name</i>]</code> format</li>
    <li>each "cell" object in the grid row array has several useful attributes: 
        <code>row</code> and <code>col</code> correspond to the position of the cell
        inside the grid array; <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are incremented in each
        row/column of the grid by <code>xSpacing</code> and <code>ySpacing</code> values
        in the configuration parameter object provided to <code>tools.generateGrid()</code> 
        method.
    </li>
    <li><code>&lt;g&gt;</code> SVG tag can be used to iterate over an array without displaying
        any visible elements and replicate a container element that would enclose other SVG elements.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Drawing paths using grid cell object</h3>
<p>Besides <code>row</code>, <code>col</code>, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties, 
    the grid cells' objects have the <code>startPath(xOffset, yOffset)</code> method
    which is designed to be used in <code>d</code> attribute of <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>
    SVG tag to compose paths. Here's an example:
</p>
<pre><code #example2>&lt;g *ngFor="let row of tools.generateGrid(&#123;
        rowsCount: 10,
        columnsCount: 10,
        xSpacing: 75,
        ySpacing: 75
    &#125;)"&gt;
    &lt;path *ngFor="let cell of row"
            fill="black"
            [attr.d]="cell.startPath(-10, -10)
                    .curveWithAngle(90,50,60,20,120,20)
                    .curveWithAngle(180,50,150,20,210,20)
                    .curveWithAngle(270,50,240,20,300,20)
                    .curveWithAngle(0,50,-30,20,30,20)"&gt;
    &lt;/path&gt;
&lt;/g&gt;
</code></pre>
<a href="#" 
   (click)="requestEdit(example2);false"
   class="try-link">Try this template in the app</a>
<p>Notice that first parameters of each <code>curveWithAngle</code> call are angles 
    in degrees (90-180-270-0) and second parameters all equal 50, so as expected
    the rendered image looks like squares, but with curved borders (again, dashed
        lines here are tiles' borders):</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="assets/result-example-2.png">
</div>
<p>If we inspect the generated SVG code we will see <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> tags
    there with some generated strings set for <code>d</code> attribute, e.g.:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;path fill=&quot;black&quot; d=&quot;M65 -10 C 82.32050807568878 -20, 97.67949192431124 -20, 115 -10 C 125 7.320508075688771, 125 22.67949192431123, 115 40 C 97.67949192431122 50, 82.32050807568878 49.99999999999999, 65 40.00000000000001 C 55 22.679491924311233, 55 7.320508075688782, 65 -9.999999999999993&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
    As we can see, the <code>startPath()</code> method returns the object with
    <code>curveWithAngle()</code> method which returns that object back which allows
    to chain curveWithAngle calls to construct a multi-line path. Below are
    the details of how this works:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The whole <code>cell.startPath(...).curveWithAngle(...)</code> construct is
        used to generate the string with path data for <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> tag's 
        <code>d</code> attribute; that generated string always starts with <code>M</code> 
        command ("move to") followed by the coordinates of the path's starting point; it is 
        followed by <code>C</code> ("curve to") commands followed by the path lines' 
        parameters each line corresponding to a <code>curveWithAngle</code> method call.
    </li>
    <li><code>startPath</code> methode can be called with two parameters: <code>startPath(xOffset, yOffset)</code>
        which set the horizontal and vertical offset of the starting point of the path relative 
        to the top left corner of the grid cell i.e. this technique is designed to easily place paths 
        repeated along the grid. If called with no parameters <code>startPath</code> method uses
        the default zero offsets setting the starting point's coordinates equal to the cell object's
        <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties.
    </li>
    <li>The second method has six parameters, which can be grouped into three angle-distance pairs:
        <pre><code>curveWithAngle(angle, distance,
               startAngle, startDistance,
               endAngle, endDistance)</code></pre>
        All three angle parameters are set in degrees where 0 direction always points to the top, 90 
        to the right, 180 to the bottom and 270 to the left i.e. positive values go clockwise; negative 
        values are also allowed so -90 is the same as 270; also values above 360 and below are also 
        allowed (405 = 360 + 45 is the same as 45 etc). Distance parameters are measured in pixels.<br>
        First pair, <code>angle, distance</code> sets where a path line's end point will be relative
        to the starting point (which is also the end point of the previous line of the path) e.g. 
        90, 100 will mean the line's end point will be 100 pixels to the right from its starting point.<br>
        Two other pairs can be omitted - this will result in a straight line being drawn; if they are provided
        it allows to draw curved lines if the angle values are different from the first <code>angle</code>
        parameter.
        <div class="text-center">
                <img src="assets/angles-diagram.png">
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>the object returned by <code>startPath</code> and <code>curveWithAngle</code> methods has also
        <code>toString()</code> method that returns the string formatted for <code>d</code> attribute
        of <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> tag but it's not necessary to call it explicitly because it is called
        anyway in the process of implicit type coercion for getting a string representation of the object.
    </li>
</ul>
